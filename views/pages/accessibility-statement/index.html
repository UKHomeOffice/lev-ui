  <p class="govuk-body">This accessibility statement applies to LEV.</p>

    <li class="govuk-body">Zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li class="govuk-body">Navigate the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li class="govuk-body">Listen to most of LEV using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="govuk-body">We've also made the website text as simple as possible to understand. <a href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk" class="govuk-link">AbilityNet</a> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>
